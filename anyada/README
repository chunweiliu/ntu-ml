anyada is a generic implementation of AdaBoost when the hypothesis can take values other than {-1, +1}

it can easily be extended to many different formulations

example

anyada(x, y, 100, vx, vy, tx, ty, stumplearn, stumpfunc)

where x is N (examples) by d (features), and y is N by 1 with values {-1, 1}.
